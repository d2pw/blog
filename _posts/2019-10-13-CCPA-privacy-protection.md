On January 1 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) goes into effect in the state of California. The CCPA is intended to protect consumers, enhance privacy rights and provide greater transparency for residents of the state of California. For some context, California's economy is larger than that of any other U.S. state. If it were a country, California would be the fifth-largest economy in the world (larger than the United Kingdom, France, or India).

**The intentions of the Act are to provide California residents with the right to:**
* know what personal data is being collected about them.
* know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.
* say no to the sale of personal data.
* access their personal data.
* request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer (subject to some exceptions).
* not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

Companies don't have to be based in or have a physical presence in the state of California to fall under the law. They don't even have to be based in the United States. Every business that deals with California consumers should take a note of the privacy rights the CCPA offers residents over their personal information.

**Businesses which meet at least one of the following criteria fall under the CCPA:**
* generate $25 million in gross annual revenue or more
* annually buy, receive, sell or share personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices for commercial purposes
* derive 50% or more of its annual revenue from selling consumer personal information

### What constitutes personal data?
Personal data in the CCPA is defined as “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household”. Section 1798.40 defines what is included under personal information and can be summarized as:
1.	Identifiers (e.g. real name, alias, postal address, email address, IP address)
2.	Personal information in customer records (e.g. signature, financial information)
3.	Legally protected characteristics (e.g. race, religion, gender, sexual orientation)
4.	Commercial information (e.g. personal property, purchasing histories)
5.	Biometric information
6.	Internet or Network Activity (e.g. browsing history, search history)
7.	Geolocation data
8.	Sensory information (e.g. audio, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information)
9.	Employment Information
10.	Education Information
11.	Metadata, or inferences drawn from above used to create a profile (e.g. predispositions)

The Attorney General has the power to add additional categories of personal information in order to address changes in technology, data collection practices, obstacles to implementation, and privacy concerns.

### CCPA security requirements and data protection
Like the GDPR, the CCPA requires that a business implements appropriate data protection measures over personal information, including both organizational and technical measures. Unlike the GDPR, the CCPA allows consumers to sue businesses when their “non-encrypted or non-redacted personal information… is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business’ violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information.” Violations of this provision are subject to statutory penalties of $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, additional actual damages, and injunctive relief.

### Risks faced by non-compliant businesses
Come January 1 2020, companies have 30 days to comply with the law once regulators notify them of a violation. If the issue isn't resolved, the CCPA allows the attorney general to seek penalties of up to $7500 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater. California citizens will have the ability to bring a civil action lawsuit against companies if the attorney general declines to prosecute, and it allows class action lawsuits for damages. Breach related costs – IT response, forensics and recovery, legal cost, notification, and so on – could push a breach into the realm of an existential threat to many businesses.

**In order to comply with the CCPA, businesses should:**
* Update privacy notices and policies now and in the future to reflect CCPA requirements;
* Add a “Do Not Sell my Data” button to their homepage;
* Train pertinent employees on the new compliance requirements of the CCPA;
* Implement systems to comply with these new privacy notices and policies and to authenticate and follow-up on legitimate consumer requests under the CCPA;
* Audit systems to ensure they can and do comply with their own privacy notices and policies and with the consumer rights provided by the CCPA.

### A work in progress…
The State of California implemented the CCPA – Assembly Bill 375 – with urgency in late June 2018 and it contained many ambiguities. The Act was passed, in part, to pre-empt a ballot initiative that was to be voted on in November 2018 and that, if passed, would have imposed stricter data privacy requirements. Since then, California legislature has passed six amendments which alter the CCPA prior to its effective date. The California legislature finished its session on September 13 and cannot make any further changes until after the CCPA becomes effective on January 1 2020. More amendments will likely occur, even after it takes effect in January 2020, but the core tenets and rights will remain.

The regulatory climate around the world for data protection is heating up. Data privacy regulations like the GDPR and CCPA are becoming the norm and organizations must implement a variety of technologies and best practices to ensure compliance with them. A failure to comply can result in significant and negative consequences, including direct financial costs through fines, loss of corporate reputation, lost business opportunities, brand damage and the like.
