## Training creates a security-conscious culture

Organizations need to be strategic and proactive in their approach to security education and awareness training, and make sure they are covering the right topics. It is important that security training programs give people the best and most effective education possible, covering all the important aspects of information security.

**5 Things information security training should help people understand:**
1. What information security is and what technologies are involved
2. What tools are used to defend against them
3. What security vulnerabilities and risks are, as well as their implications
4. What the industry’s standards and regulations are
5. The role users play in helping keep their organization secure

Organizations that do not effectively support employees with the right tools and awareness are more vulnerable to carelessness, malware and targeted attacks.

Users have a critical role to play in their organization’s security. It is important that security guidelines and the technology provided enable users to do their job, as well as to help keep the organization secure. This can be supported by awareness programs and training that deliver security expertise and establish a security-conscious culture.
