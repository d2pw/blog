## Keep Information Systems current & up to date
Keeping information systems up to date is a complex process. The importance of each stage of the patch process--and the amount of time and resources you should spend on it--will depend on your organization's infrastructure, requirements and overall security posture.  

* Develop an up-to-date inventory of systems.
* Devise a plan for standardizing systems.
* Make a list of all the security controls in place.
* Compare reported vulnerabilities against inventory/control list.
* Classify the risk, assess vulnerabilities and the likelihood of attacks
* Introduce a secure procedure to patch information systems

Vulnerability and patch management isn't easy. In today's computing environment, it's a never-ending cycle.
