<p class="lead">“If we guard our toothbrushes and diamonds with equal zeal, we will lose fewer toothbrushes and more diamonds.”  
-- <cite>McGeorge Bundy, US National Security Advisor speaking to President John F. Kennedy</cite></p>  

## Data is one of your most important assets
Increasingly our world runs on data; some of it critical, much of it confidential. Information has become one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. This [Harvard Business School article](https://digit.hbs.org/submission/caesars-entertainment-what-happens-in-vegas-ends-up-in-a-1billion-database/){:target="_blank"} highlights Caesar’s Entertainment loyalty program, _Total Rewards_. The data in _Total Rewards_ was estimated to be worth over $1 billion and was at the center of a very heated Caesar’s Palace bankruptcy feud with its creditors. Information in the loyalty program was deemed a more valuable asset then physical property, including the Roman-themed resort on the Las Vegas strip.

Protecting intangible assets like intellectual property, critical company data or reputation against risk is a business requirement. It begins by identifying vital data. Once identified, the limited resources available can be optimally used to secure it. The quote by McGeorge Bundy illustrates this, comparing toothbrushes to diamonds. A more contemporary  situation would be to compare the value of a medical practices’ balance sheet of long-term assets (lease, medical equipment...) vs. a database containing client medical records. A stolen portable ultrasound machine could easily be replaced at the cost of thousands dollars, without putting the future of the clinic at risk. A breach in the clinics information system resulting in client medical records getting into the wrong hands could have a devastating effect on the clinic, both financially (ligation, regulatory investigations & fines) and on their reputation.

By analyzing the exposure of data to threats and vulnerabilities, informed decisions help mitigate the risks to essential information, both today and in the foreseeable future. A [**risk assessment**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-13-risk-assessment %}) is a valuable tool for an organization deciding how to counter risks to one of it's most important asset, information.
