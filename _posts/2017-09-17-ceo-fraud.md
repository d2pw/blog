## How do you stop highly skilled criminals?
CEO fraud is a very sophisticated type of fraud in which highly skilled criminals attempt to penetrate a companyâ€™s internal network. Gathering information on organizational structure and security procedures enables them to spoof company email accounts and impersonate executives. Their aim is to deceive employees in financial positions into initiating an urgent wire transfer of funds. These targeted attacks have a high success rate, sometimes enabling the perpetrators to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars from victimized organizations.
