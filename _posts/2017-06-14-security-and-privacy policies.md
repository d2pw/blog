## Security and Privacy policies steer your organization

**Security policy**  
The objectives of an IT security policy is the preservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information used by an organization’s members. These three principles compose the CIA triad:

* **Confidentiality —** involves the protection of assets from unauthorized entities
* **Integrity —** ensures the modification of assets is handled in a specified and authorized manner
* **Availability —** is a state of the system in which authorized users have continuous access to said assets

The IT Security Policy is a living document that is continually updated to adapt with evolving business and IT requirements. An organizations information security policy should reflect it's objectives for security and the agreed upon strategy for securing information.

**Privacy policy**  
A privacy policy is a statement or a legal document (in privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's data. It fulfills a legal requirement to protect a customer or client's privacy. Personal information can be anything that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to the person's name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue and expiry date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services. In the case of a business it is often a statement that declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises.  

Privacy Policy agreements are mandatory because in certain cases collecting data can be used to identify an individual.
