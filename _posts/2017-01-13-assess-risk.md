<p class="lead">“If we guard our toothbrushes and diamonds with equal zeal, we will lose fewer toothbrushes and more diamonds.”

### Data is one of your most important assets
Increasingly our world runs on data; some of it critical, much of it confidential. Information has become one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. This [Harvard Business School article](https://digit.hbs.org/submission/caesars-entertainment-what-happens-in-vegas-ends-up-in-a-1billion-database/){:target="_blank"} highlights Caesar’s Entertainment loyalty program, _Total Rewards_. The data in _Total Rewards_ was estimated to be worth over $1 billion and at the center of a very heated Caesar’s Palace bankruptcy feud with its creditors. Information in the loyalty program was deemed a more valuable asset then physical property, including the Roman-themed resort on the Las Vegas strip.

Protecting assets like intellectual property, critical company records or reputation against risk is a business requirement. It begins by identifying vital data. Once identified, we can begin to optimally use the limited resources available to secure them. The quote by McGeorge Bundy at the top of the page illustrates this, comparing toothbrushes vs. diamonds. A comparable situation would be the value awarded by a medical practices’ balance sheet of long-term assets (lease, medical equipment, furniture...) vs. a database containing client medical records. The later getting into the wrong hands could have a devastating effect on the clinic, both financially and on their reputation.

By analyzing the exposure of data to threats and vulnerabilities, informed decisions help mitigate the risks essential information is increasingly subject to both today and in the future. A [**risk assessment**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-13-risk-assessment %}) is essential to planning which steps are needed to counter the insecurity faced by organizations in an continuously shifting landscape.
