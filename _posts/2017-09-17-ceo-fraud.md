## How do you stop highly skilled criminals?
CEO Fraud is a very sophisticated type of fraud in which highly skilled criminals attempt to penetrate a companyâ€™s internal network. Gathering information on organizational structure, and security procedures, enables them to spoof company email accounts and impersonate executives to deceive employees in financial positions to initiate an urgent wire transfer of funds. These targeted attacks have a high success rate, sometimes enabling the perpetrators to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars from victimized organizations.

As is the case with other types of malicious attacks [multiple layers of security]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-13-securing-assets %}) are recommended as part of an effective prevention program:

The key is to train staff to recognize suspicious emails and other communications, and to provide clear procedures when dealing with fund transfers in particular.
