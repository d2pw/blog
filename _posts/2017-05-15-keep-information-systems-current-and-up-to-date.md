## Keep your Information Systems current
Keeping information systems up to date is a complex process. The importance of each stage of the process, and the amount of time and resources spent on it, will depend on an organization's infrastructure, requirements and overall security posture.  

**Procedures devised to keep systems secure consists of:**

* Developing an up-to-date inventory of systems.
* Devising a plan for standardizing systems.
* Making a list of all the security controls in place.
* Comparing reported vulnerabilities against inventory/control lists.
* Classifying risk, assess vulnerabilities and the likelihood of attacks.
* Introducing a secure procedure to patch information systems.

Vulnerability and patch management isn't easy. In today's computing environment, it's a never-ending cycle. Information systems in an organization need to be current if they are to withstand constantly evolving threats.
