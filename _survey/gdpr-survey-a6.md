**6. Do you use personal information in a way it was not initially intended for when collected?**

**You answered yes.**

When people give you their contact details to get a response to a question or to obtain information about a product, they trust you with their information. If you use it to send them newsletters they didn’t ask for, or sell it to another company, you are not protecting that information.

Under the GDPR you must tell people what data you collect and what you intend to do with it. And you must ask them to expressly agree to that — you cannot assume they agree and ask them to say if they do not. You must get them to opt in, not opt out.
