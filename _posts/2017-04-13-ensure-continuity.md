### Develop Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plans
A business continuity plan outlines procedures and instructions an organization must follow in the face of disaster, whether fire, flood or cyberattack. 

#### What is business continuity?
Business continuity (BC) refers to maintaining business functions or quickly resuming them in the event of a major disruption, whether caused by a fire, flood or malicious attack by cybercriminals. A business continuity plan outlines procedures and instructions an organization must follow in the face of such disasters; it covers business processes, assets, human resources, business partners and more.

Many people think a disaster recovery (DR) plan is the same as a business continuity plan, but a DR plan focuses mainly on restoring an IT infrastructure and operations after a crisis. It's actually just one part of a complete business continuity plan, as a BC plan looks at the continuity of the entire organization.

#### Why business continuity planning matters

Whether you operate a small business or a large corporation, you strive to remain competitive. It's vital to retain current customers while increasing your customer base â€” and there's no better test of your capability to do so than right after an adverse event.

#### The importance of testing your business continuity plan

Testing a plan is the only way to truly know it will work. Rigorously test a plan to know if it's complete and will fulfill its intended purpose.
