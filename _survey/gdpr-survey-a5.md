**5. Do you use the personal information you collect on people to make decisions that impact them?**

**You answered yes**

If personal information from an EU resident is processed automatically and may lead to a decision which may impact them, you must be able to show that no discrimination is possible. Under the new GRPR you must be able to cease automatic processing of an individualâ€™s information upon their request.
