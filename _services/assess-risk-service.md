## Data is one of your most important assets
Increasingly our world runs on data; some of it critical, much of it confidential. Information has become one of the most valuable assets an organization possesses. This [Harvard Business School article](https://digit.hbs.org/submission/caesars-entertainment-what-happens-in-vegas-ends-up-in-a-1billion-database/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"} highlights Caesar’s Entertainment loyalty program, _Total Rewards_.

> #### The most valuable asset in the Caesar’s Entertainment Corp. isn’t the fabulously-tacky Roman-themed resort on the Las Vegas strip.  It’s the company’s big data loyalty program, valued at $1 billion.
-- <cite>Harvard Business School</cite>

The data in _Total Rewards_ was estimated to be worth over $1 billion and was at the centre of a very heated Caesar’s Palace bankruptcy feud with its creditors. Information in the loyalty program was deemed a more valuable asset then physical property, including the Roman-themed resort on the Las Vegas strip.

**Not convinced information is at the center of your organization?**  
This recent article by The World Economic Forum, [The value of data](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/the-value-of-data/){:rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"}{:target="_blank"} _states:_

> #### In this age of hyper connected consumers, data is definitely the new age ‘oil’.

The world produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of information each day. Data is an intangible asset, a non-monetary asset that is not physical in nature. Intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and business methodologies, are intangible assets too. Protecting intellectual property, critical company data or reputation against risk, is a business requirement. How can your organization effectively assign the limited resources available to optimally secure its valuable data, intellectual property or reputation? By identifying critical data, business processes and people, organizations can focus their efforts on securing key elements against threat efficiently and effectively.

> #### If we guard our toothbrushes and diamonds with equal zeal, we will lose fewer toothbrushes and more diamonds.”  
-- <cite>McGeorge Bundy, US National Security Advisor speaking to President John F. Kennedy</cite>

The quote by McGeorge Bundy illustrates this, comparing toothbrushes to diamonds. A contemporary situation would be to compare the value of a medical practice's balance sheet of long-term assets (lease, medical equipment...) vs. a database containing client medical records. A stolen portable ultrasound machine could be replaced at the cost of thousands of dollars, without putting the future of the clinic at risk. A breach in the clinic's information systems, resulting in client medical records getting into the wrong hands, could have a devastating effect on the clinic, both financially (litigation, regulatory investigations and fines) as well as on their reputation.

By analyzing the exposure of data to threats and vulnerabilities, informed decisions help mitigate the risks to essential information. A **risk assessment** is a valuable tool and the first step for an organization deciding how to counter risks to one of its most important asset: information.
