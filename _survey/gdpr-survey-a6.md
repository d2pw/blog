**6. Do you use personal information in a way it was not initially intended for when collected?

**You answered yes**

Under the GDPR you must tell people what data you collect and what you intend to do with it. Ask them to expressly agree to that â€” You cannot assume they agree and ask them to say if they do not. You must get them to opt in.
