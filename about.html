<p>We offer in-depth knowledge and expertise in analysis of data security risk. Our experience working with local businesses,
   governmental agencies and Fortune 500 companies gives us the ability to help organizations of all sizes better perceive risk
   and take the necessary steps to mitigate them. We have assisted organizations develop and implement solutions to manage personal
   identifiable information (PII), making sure proper procedures are in place to ensure compliance with local data protection agencies
   such as the CNIL in France and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)</p>

   mission to contribute to an organizations policy of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its data.</p>
