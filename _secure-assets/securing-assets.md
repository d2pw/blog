## Multiple security layers protect data
Layered security, also known as layered defense, describes the practice of combining multiple mitigating security controls to protect resources and data. The term bears some similarity to defense in depth, a term adopted from a military strategy that involves multiple layers of defense.  
Malware comes in many forms and evolves to use different strategies to infect targets. It may use links in email or social media, slip in through web applications, or through physical network access. Malware is taking advantage of conventional endpoints and mobile devices, slipping past network security, and even taking advantage of the human element operating the devices.

**Setting up a comprehensive security solution**  
Using multiple layers together, and combining them in a coordinated effort can stop most attacks. In the case of new, more sophisticated malware, your solution should be capable of slowing the attack down and enabling network monitors to detect the attack and raise the alarm before serious damage is done.

**Steps in conceiving an effective prevention program include:**

* [**Identify risk -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/risk-assessment.md %}) Carry out a risk assessment
* [**Define security and privacy policies -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/security-and-privacy-policies.md %})
	Reflect the objectives set by management
* [**Customize education, training and awareness programs -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/educate-staff.md %}) Identify and adapt training for all users
* [**Keep information systems current and up to date -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/keep-information-systems-up-to-date.md %})
	Audit information systems and define your update and patching procedures
* [**Develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/ensure-continuity.md %})
	Backups, incident management, contingency planning
* [**Install preventive controls -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/install-preventive-controls.md %})
	Firewalls and endpoint security
* [**Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/audit-trails.md %})
	Alerts, logs and audit trails
* [**Evaluate cyber liability insurance -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _secure-assets/cyber-insurance.md %}) A last resort against catastrophic breaches

Organizations need to determine their key information assets, identify where vulnerabilities lie and, design security that will protect them from attack and detect any breach they may face.
