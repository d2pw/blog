## Protect your organization against ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that, when it infects computers, restricts user access to files, and often threatens the permanent deletion of data, unless a crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin) ransom is paid. The threat of ransomware is expected to increase with the rise of crypto-currencies. Digital currencies allow cybercriminals to operate without the fear of retribution since payments are not easily tracked by law enforcement agencies. The FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that _over $24 million was paid to attackers in 2015. In Q1 of 2016 alone, ransomware costs rose to $209 million, and is projected to reach $1 billion by year's end._

**Cyber-attacks are neither industry nor sector specific. Organizations of all sizes can be targets.**

Organizations need to define how they detect, protect and respond to ransomware attacks. As is the case with other types of malicious attacks, [multiple layers of security]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _services/protect-assets-service.md %}) is a recommended approach:

* **Identify risk -** Carry out a risk assessment
* **Define security and privacy policies -** Reflect the objectives set by management
* **Customize education, training and awareness programs -** Identify and adapt training for all users
* **Keep information systems current and up to date -** Audit information systems and define update procedures
* **Develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans -** Backups, incident management, contingency planning
* **Install preventive controls -** Firewalls and endpoint security
* **Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails -** Alerts, logs and audit trails
* **Evaluate cyber liability insurance -** A last resort against catastrophic breaches

Ransomware attacks should be reported to the proper authorities. In most cases, authorities will strongly suggest not paying a ransom in response to an attack. There is, after all, no guarantee that paying a ransom will result in the recovery of the data in question. It goes without saying, preventing a malware attack is a preferable approach.
