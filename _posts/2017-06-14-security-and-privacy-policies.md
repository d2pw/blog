## Security and privacy policies are an important first step

**Security policy**  
The objective of an IT security policy is the preservation of the confidentiality, the integrity, and the availability of systems and information used by an organization’s members. These three principles compose the "CIA" triad:

* **Confidentiality —** involves the protection of assets from unauthorized entities
* **Integrity —** ensures the modification of assets is handled in a specified and authorized manner
* **Availability —** is a state of the system in which authorized users have continuous access to said assets

The IT Security Policy is a living document that is continually updated to adapt to evolving business and IT requirements. An organization's information security policy should reflect its objectives for security and the agreed-upon strategy for securing information.

**Privacy policy**  
A privacy policy is a statement or a legal document (in privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer’s or client’s personal information and data. It fulfills a legal requirement to protect a customer’s or client’s privacy. Personal information can be anything that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to the person's name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue and expiry date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services. In the case of a business, it is often a statement that declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it has gathered. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept private, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises.  

Privacy policy agreements are mandatory because, in certain cases, collected data can be used to identify an individual.
