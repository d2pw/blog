## Protect your organization against ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that, when it infects computers, restricts user access to files, and often threatens the permanent deletion of data, unless a crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin) ransom is paid. The threat of ransomware is expected to increase with the rise of crypto-currencies. Digital currencies allow cybercriminals to operate without the fear of retribution since payments are not easily tracked by law enforcement agencies. The FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that _over $24 million was paid to attackers in 2015. In Q1 of 2016 alone, ransomware costs rose to $209 million, and is projected to reach $1 billion by year's end._

**Cyber-attacks are neither industry nor sector specific. Organizations of all sizes can be targets.**

Organizations must balance how they detect, protect and respond to ransomware attacks. As is the case with other types of malicious attacks, [multiple layers of security]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-13-securing-assets %}) are recommended:

* [**Identify risk -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-13-risk-assessment %}) Carry out a risk assessment
* [**Define security and privacy policies -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-14-security-and-privacy-policies %})
	Reflect the objectives set by management
* [**Customize education, training and awareness programs -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-13-educate-staff %}) Identify and adapt training for all users
* [**Keep information systems current and up to date -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-15-keep-information-systems-up-to-date %})
	Audit information systems and define update procedures
* [**Develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-13-ensure-continuity %})
	Backups, incident management, contingency planning
* [**Install preventive controls -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-16-install-preventive-controls %})
	Firewalls and endpoint security
* [**Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-19-audit-trails %})
	Alerts, logs and audit trails
* [**Evaluate cyber liability insurance -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-07-26-cyber-insurance %}) A last resort against catastrophic breaches

Ransomware attacks should be reported to the proper authorities. In most cases, authorities will strongly suggest not paying a ransom in response to an attack. There is, after all, no guarantee that paying a ransom will result in the recovery of the data in question.
