## GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation

The GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation - is in the news this year. Personal data protection in Europe is nothing new. With the new GDPR regulation, the European Commission, European Parliament and the Council for the European Union have set out to strengthen and unify legal protection of people’s personally identifiable information (PII).  
It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU. The GDPR aims to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business, by unifying the regulation within the EU. The GDPR takes effect May 25 2018 after a two-year transition period.

### Steps towards compliance
**Plan the GDPR compliance process —** It is important to define the process an organization will take towards reaching full compliance. Not only does it set down internal goals, it demonstrates to local Data Protection Associations (DPA), responsible for enforcing GDPR in each country, that your organization is serious about compliance.

**Allocate resources to achieve compliance —** An organization has to allocate the necessary resources to ensure compliance. Put someone in charge and provide ample resources to achieve goals set by management. Having a clear understanding of the legal framework and the operational skills to achieve compliance is the basis for success.

**Analyze your data —**  Personal identifiable information (PII) must be identified. It is, after all, what the GDPR is all about. What PII is your organization handling? Is it necessary to your organization? Is storing it necessary?

**Protect PII —** Evaluate protection strategies ensuring proper encryption and access guidelines are in place. If anonymizing all or part of the data, ensure the process can't be reversed.

The GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018. Organizations must not only achieve compliance by this date, but also ensure they have measures in place to remain compliant afterwards. Having a data protection strategy in place and making sure it’s always current are essential to avoid non-compliance issues and a possible devastating loss of reputation.
