## Insuring against a major breach
With cyber attacks, malware, ransomware and privacy breaches making daily headlines, the need to develop a comprehensive security and privacy strategy is pressing. An important part of a security and privacy strategy can be cyber and privacy insurance. These insurance policies protect against risks relating to information security and privacy. Risks that could include and are not limited to:

**Cyber Insurance**

* Malware
* Unauthorized access
* Security breach
* Release of data through the carelessness of an employee or vendor
* CEO Fraud, Deceptive Funds Transfer or Social Engineering
* Loss of use and the resulting business interruption
* Costs incurred to recover from a breach

**Privacy Insurance**

* Notification costs
* Costs to defend claims by regulators
* Fines and penalties
* Loss resulting from identity theft
* Business interruption
* Data loss or destruction
* Cyberextortion

Every organization needs to look into cyber and privacy insurance as part of a global strategy. It is important to determine the policy and level of insurance you need and feel comfortable with. Finding an insurer in your field with experience in cyber and privacy insurance is essential. Finally, only buy from an insurer with a proven track record in this domain.

Buying insurance is not the end of it. An organization needs to deploy the necessary resources to shield itself from risk, as insurance policies require that reasonable steps are in place to protect assets. Insurance policies are a last resort to protect an organization from the catastrophic consequences resulting from a major breach.
