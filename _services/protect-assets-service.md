## We ensure the availability of your information
The ever increasing complexity of modern day systems are often required by organizations in need of uninterrupted access to sensitive business information and confidential client data. These systems often mix cloud based architectures with  mobile devices, making it imperative to thoroughly analyze the risks faced by critical data and adopt a global solution to protect against evolving threats to data confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Setting up a comprehensive security solution**  
Layered security, also known as layered defense, describes the practice of combining multiple security controls to protect resources and data. Using multiple layers together, and combining them in a coordinated effort can greatly reduce most risks of accidental loss or cyberattacks. In the case of new, more sophisticated malware, a solution based on multiple layers of security (defensive tools combined with both online and offline backups) should be capable of slowing the attack down and enabling network monitors to detect the attack and raise the alarm before serious damage is done.

**Steps in conceiving an effective prevention program include:**

* **Identify risk -** Carry out a risk assessment
* **Define security and privacy policies -** Define the objectives
* **Customize training and awareness programs -** Identify and adapt training for all users
* **Keep information systems current and up to date -** Audit information systems and define update procedures
* **Install preventive controls -** Install Firewalls, endpoint security and activity monitors

Organizations need to determine their key information assets, identify where vulnerabilities lie and, design security that will protect them from accidental loss or attack and detect any breach they may face.
