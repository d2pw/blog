## We increase your resilience to future threats
Large organizations are not the only ones that can be affected by unexpected disruptions. Small companies face similar threats too; in fact, most smaller business would not survive a major disruption without a firm continuity plan. Believing that ‘It won’t happen to us’ is unwise, no matter the size of your organization. The capability to respond effectively is critical. Preparing a business continuity plan can at least provide reassurance to you – and your customers – that in the event of a disaster, your essential business operations can continue.

**It’s about the business, not the technology**  
A disaster recovery plan should take into account the complete spectrum of “potential interrupters” to your business, and it should spell out a recovery plan for each scenario. Not all scenarios are equally likely to occur, and a key assessment to make is to anticipate which potential disruptors are most probable and to affect resources to preparing for the most likely incidents. A key mistake when preparing a plan is to put too much focus on technology and not enough on people and process. Identifying by name the critical people charged with responding to a crisis is critical. Identifying people and process will help understand the business priorities. Then, it will be a simple process of identifying which elements of the IT environment support these priorities.

### We help you prepare against malware or a security breach
We can identify the potential threats you face, and help you evaluate there business impact. Once a clear picture of the risk you face if you are the victim of malware or a security breach is established, recovery plans can be but in place to efficiently and effectively face the disruption. Evaluating the business impact is key; how can you assign budget without knowing the cost of downtime?

**The importance of testing your business continuity plan**  
Testing a plan is the only way to truly know it will work. We will rigorously test a plan to know if it's complete and if it fulfills its intended purpose. A real incident is a true test and the best way to know if it works. However, a controlled testing strategy is much more comfortable and provides an opportunity to identify gaps and improve procedures. It is important to ensure the objectives are measurable, with the key objective being to assure that essential operations can continue with the least amount of down time. Doing the minimum and 'getting away with it' leads to a weak plan and no confidence in the face of a real incident. We'll insure you're prepared and confident.

### Don’t wait
The biggest mistake organizations of all sizes make is waiting until after a cyber attack or disaster to figure out what to do next. Generally an organization will not fail because of a data breach. It will collapse due to their failure to respond properly to the breach, the result of not having a crisis plan in place. It’s important to not only to build better defenses, but also better responses.
