## Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails
Audit trails maintain a record of system activity, both by system and application processes and by user activity of systems and applications. In conjunction with appropriate tools and procedures, audit trails can assist in detecting security violations, performance problems, and flaws in applications.

Without appropriate audit logging, an attacker's activities can go unnoticed, and evidence of whether or not the attack led to a breach can be inconclusive.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network security technology originally built for detecting vulnerability exploits (breaches) against a target application or computer. The IDS monitors traffic and reports its results to an administrator, but cannot automatically take action to prevent a detected exploit from taking over the system. Attackers are capable of exploiting vulnerabilities very quickly once they enter a network, rendering the IDS an inadequate deployment for prevention, but valuable in raising the alert when suspicious activity is detected.
