## Multiple security layers protects data
Layered security, also known as layered defense, describes the practice of combining multiple mitigating security controls to protect resources and data. The term bears some similarity to defense in depth, a term adopted from a military strategy that involves multiple layers of defense.  
Malware comes in many forms and evolves to use different strategies to infect targets. It may use links in email or social media, slip in through web applications, or through physical network access. Malware is taking advantage of conventional endpoints and mobile devices, slipping past network security, and even taking advantage of the human element operating the devices.

**Setting up a comprehensive security solution**  
Using multiple layers together, and combining them in a coordinated effort can stop most attacks. In the case of new, more sophisticated malware it should be capable of slowing the attack down and enable network monitors to detect the attack and raise the alert before serious damage is done.

**Steps in conceiving an effective prevention program include:**

* [**Identify Risk -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-13-risk-assessment %}) Perform a Risk Assessment
* [**Define Security & Privacy Policies -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-14-security-and-privacy policies %})
	Reflect the objectives set by management
* [**Customize Education, Training & Awareness Programs -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-13-educate-staff %}) Identify and adapt training for all users
* [**Keep Information Systems current & up to date -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-15-keep-information-systems-current-and-up-to-date %})
	Audit information systems & define update procedures
* [**Develop Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plans -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-13-ensure-continuity %})
	Backups, incident management, contingency planning
* [**Install Preventive Controls -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-16-install-preventive-controls %})
	Firewalls, endpoint security and IPS
* [**Maintain Comprehensive Logs and Audit Trails -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-19-audit-trails %})
	Alerts, logs and audit trails
* [**Assess Cyber Liability Insurance -**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-07-26-cyber-insurance %}) A last resort against catastrophic breaches

Organizations need to determine their key information assets, identify where vulnerabilities lie and design security that will protect them from attack and detect any breach they may face.
