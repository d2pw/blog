**9. Can personal information stored in your organization be accessed without trace?**

**You answered yes.**

If personal information of EU residents can be accessed without you knowing about it, it is not protected.

The GDPR requires that special care be taken to limit access to personal data, therefore all access should be logged. Any breach of personal information must be reported to the supervisory Data Protection Authority (DPA) without undue delay, and at the latest within 72 hours after having become aware of the breach. If the breach concerns information that presents a high risk to the rights or freedoms of the person(s), you will need to notify those affected directly.
