## Protect your organization against ransomware.
Ransomware is a type of malware that, upon infection of computers or mobile devices, restricts user access to files and often threatens the permanent deletion of data unless a crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin) ransom is paid. The threat of ransomware is expected to steadily increase with the rise of crypto-currencies. Digital currencies allow cybercriminals to operate without the fear of retribution since payments are not easily tracked by law enforcement agencies. The FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that _over $24 million was paid to attackers in 2015. In Q1 of 2016 alone, ransomware costs rose to $209 million, and is projected to reach $1 billion by year's end._

**Cyber-attacks are neither industry nor sector specific. Organizations of all sizes can be targets.**

To combat the rise in ransomware, multiple layers of security are recommended. Organizations must balance how they detect, protect and respond to ransomware attacks.  Every measure to [secure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-15-securing-assets %}) your data infrastructure should be in place:

* [**Identify Risk**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-13-risk-assessment %})
* Define Security & Privacy Policies
* [**Customize Training & Awareness Programs**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-13-educate-staff %})
* Keep Information Systems current & up to date
* [**Develop Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plans**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-13-ensure-continuity %})
* Install Preventive Controls
* Maintain Comprehensive Logs and Audit Trails
* [**Assess Cyber Liability Insurance**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-07-26-cyber-insurance %})

Ransomware attacks should be reported to the proper authorities. In most cases authorities will strongly suggest to avoid paying a ransom in response to an attack. There is, after all, no guarantee that paying a ransom will result in the recovery of the data in question.
